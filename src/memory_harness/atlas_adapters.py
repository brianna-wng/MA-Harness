"""Atlas SearchStore adapter over the accepted trusted-procedure service.

This module is the narrow STEP-04 integration seam that turns the already
accepted ``procedures.TrustedProcedureService.resolve_atlas``
discovery/exact-read/delivery path into one real ``search.SearchStore`` input
for ``preparation.PreparationService``.  It adds no second authority: the
accepted service keeps owning discovery limits, exact reads, recipient and
predicate revalidation, current-designation and revocation checks, exact
representation comparison, and the narrower-scope selection, and this adapter
only converts the deliveries that service already validated into
integrity-bound procedure candidates with their exact
logical/revision/publication identity, approval and current-designation
evidence, recipient scope, predicate result, live freshness, and provenance.

The store consumes only the already sanitized bounded-search query payload it
is handed: the exact representation identity and at most 32 sanitized tokens
of one search attempt.  It never re-sanitizes, widens, or rebuilds that query,
and it never treats a discovery score as relevance: candidates are scored on
the same comparable sanitized representation the bounded search itself
compares.  The store declares ``requires_network=True`` so the preparation
gate suppresses the actual task-path call when ``atlas_shared_retrieval`` is
disabled or the network mode is ``restricted_local``.
