# memory_harness

## Isolated SQLite snapshot and restore

`snapshot.SnapshotService` captures one initialized `MemoryStore` into a new
artifact directory and restores it into a closed `MemoryStore` at a nonexistent
path. Supply a fixed operator authorizer at construction; it receives
`(action, exact_scope, store_path, credential)` and must return literal `True`.
The four scope fields are `application`, `project`, `namespace`, and `owner`.
That grant must cover the entire exact MemoryStore file at `store_path` under
that four-field ownership scope. The service backs up every row in that file;
it provides no subset, partition, or multi-tenant filtering. If the authorizer
cannot grant the whole path and scope, it must reject the call. Export checks
the grant before reading source bytes, and restore checks it before target
mutation.
Per-call credentials are inputs to this fixed authorizer, never replacement
authority. An absent, rejecting, or throwing authorizer fails closed.

```python
from memory_harness.snapshot import SnapshotService
from memory_harness.store import MemoryStore

service = SnapshotService(authorizer=operator_authorizer)
scope = {"application": "harness", "project": "product",
         "namespace": "isolated", "owner": "root-agent"}
source = MemoryStore("source/memory.sqlite3")
source.initialize()
manifest = service.export(source, "capture", scope=scope, credential=operator_credential)
target = MemoryStore("fresh/memory.sqlite3")  # closed; file does not exist
result = service.restore("capture", target, scope=scope, credential=operator_credential)
# result["capture"] has capture-time facts; result["restored"] has current readiness.
target.initialize()
```

The published `capture/` directory contains `state.sqlite3` and
`manifest.json` (`snapshot/v1`). The manifest binds the exact source root,
path, scope, capture time, store format and schema digest, database SHA-256,
the `source.scope_boundary` value `whole_memory_store_file`,
its own canonical content hash, completeness, dependency references/readiness,
and pending dispatch/effect/remote-operation statuses. The whole SQLite store
is backed up; no domain IDs, configuration digests, or operation statuses are
remapped. A failed capture leaves no published artifact. Restore checks all
integrity and compatibility facts before installing into a fresh path and
never merges, overwrites, or replays work. Reopen the restored store, then use
the existing STEP-09/10 exact reconciliation paths for pending or uncertain
remote effects. A preflight failure leaves the source and target file intact.

`export(..., dependencies=[{"capability": "atlas", "reference": "..."}])`
adds source-specific references. Protected review references and known EverOS
and Atlas operation references are discovered from the backup. They default to
unready. A constructor-bound `dependency_verifier(capability, reference,
exact_scope)` may attest them. A capture-time claim requires its proof at export;
restore rechecks references whose capture-time proof was ready.
The census includes both outcome-owned and source-owned remote effects.
`restore(..., required_capabilities=("local", "atlas"))` requires at least one
specific Atlas reference with valid capture and current verifier proof, and
refuses an unready requested capability before target mutation. The same rule
applies to `experience`; an empty reference list never grants a remote
capability. Unresolved dependencies make the capture manifest `incomplete`.
Local-only restore may still proceed and returns `{"capture": manifest,
"restored": {"completeness": "complete"|"incomplete", "capabilities":
{"local": bool, "experience": bool, "atlas": bool}, "dependencies": [...]}}`.
`capture` retains the exact capture-time facts and hash. `restored` recomputes
each dependency's `ready` status from capture proof and the current verifier;
its completeness is `incomplete` if any listed dependency is unavailable.
Remote capabilities without specific references are `False` even when local
completeness is `complete`. The artifact bytes are not rewritten. SQLite
capture does not prove simultaneous remote state or protected-source
availability. Lane 2 must
bind real operator authority; lanes 3 and 4 must supply their dependency proof.

`memory_harness` is the Stage-A Python package for deterministic memory- and
plan-reuse contracts.  It provides:

- canonical task, plan, decision, dispatch, operation, and outcome records;
- an integrity-bound parent execution envelope;
- durable SQLite decision, operation, and outcome storage;
- privacy guards for control credentials and known synthetic secrets;
- fixed Standard/Problem-focused/Deeper configuration with an explicit
  `deferred/not implemented` boundary for learned selection;
- versioned local templates with direct-fill and fresh-plan fallback;
- a thin APC request/result contract that requires an explicit
  `apc_adaptation_binding`;
- deterministic reviewed-experience and Atlas fixture adapters;
- one bounded preparation, final context, and at-most-once reconciled dispatch.

The package intentionally does **not** provide a second launcher, scheduler,
review system, evidence ledger, secret manager, learned selector, or benchmark
runner.

## Bounded preparation and one safe dispatch

preparation.PreparationService.prepare owns one logical decision: it resolves
the exact task/plan state, fixed strategy, network mode, stage allowance, and
positive execution reserve *before* any optional call, then runs one bounded
fault-isolated search over the enabled local/Atlas/EverOS adapters.  The one
selected template becomes a typed direct fill, one bounded product-harness APC
drafting child (through an explicit `apc_adaptation_binding`), or the normal
fresh-plan fallback.  A late Level 0 admission permanently supersedes the old
packet and permits at most one bounded ordinary re-prepare without replenishing
spent time.

For a persisted preparation, `prepare` identifies continuation by the exact
task-card digest (including repository base), objective, route, and plan
ID/state/digest. A retry with no `request` or `network_mode` uses the captured
fixed strategy, feature gates, and network mode, even if service defaults have
changed. An explicit conflicting per-call policy raises `MandatoryStateFailure`
before optional work; recover the mandatory state or supply a genuinely new
task/plan identity for a new decision. The first decision and preparation are
claimed together in one SQLite transaction.

For a SearchStore queried from an exact durable preparation, both the initial
bounded search and final live source recheck include an additive
`policy_context` with exactly `schema="memory-search-policy-context/v1"`,
`preparation_id`, and `preparation_digest` (the preparation's `content_hash`).
`BoundedSearch.run(..., policy_context=None)` and store-free preparation omit
this field; existing callbacks may ignore it. Supplied contexts have a closed
three-field shape, a lowercase 64-hex preparation ID, and a lowercase 64-hex
digest. A persisted preparation with an unsafe custom ID cannot call a network
store without safe attribution. The field is an opaque pointer, not permission.
A governed store must read that exact preparation from the
same `MemoryStore`, validate the full record and content hash, check its rich
network resolution and context, and compare the query route before allowing
task-path work. Missing or mismatched attribution must not be treated as an
authorized network profile. Query payloads do not carry raw task, objective,
or plan IDs, configuration, deadlines, full preparations, or credentials.

`context.finalize_context` renders mandatory task/accepted-plan state first,
packs whole eligible optional items inside the configured allowance, rechecks
plan-affecting freshness, and binds one integrity over the actual task,
objective, repository base, accepted plan, rendered items, and role separation.
`runtime.MemoryRuntime.dispatch` (and the harness `memory_handoff` seam)
persists launch intent before the existing product-harness launcher runs and
records the exact observed invocation afterwards; a lost acknowledgement leaves
one visibly ambiguous operation that must be reconciled before any retry.
All-off configuration returns through the inherited harness path and performs
no optional call, no APC launch, and no background effect.

## Optional EverOS reviewed-experience adapter

The EverOS adapter is an optional Python 3.12+ dependency.  It uses only the
public `memorize`, `search`, `SearchRequest`, and `MemoryRoot` imports, while
the local SQLite store remains authoritative for ROOT review receipts,
provenance, uncertainty, and approval evidence.

From a source checkout containing `harness/vendor/everos`, create a clean
Python 3.12 environment and install both packages.  These commands do not add
the vendor source tree to `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path`:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv-everos
& .\.venv-everos\Scripts\python -m pip install --upgrade pip
& .\.venv-everos\Scripts\python -m pip install -e harness/vendor/everos
& .\.venv-everos\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[everos]"
```

On POSIX, use `python3.12 -m venv .venv-everos` and
`.venv-everos/bin/python` in place of the PowerShell executable path.  The
package metadata pins the compatible `everos==1.3.1` optional extra; the
editable vendored install above supplies that distribution locally.

Configure the scoped root before loading the public surface, then bind the
adapter to that captured root.  A missing, mismatched, or later-rebound
`EVEROS_ROOT` is rejected rather than treated as a namespace fallback:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

from memory_harness.experience import (
    EverOSAdapter,
    ExperienceScope,
    load_vendored_everos_public_surface,
)

scope = ExperienceScope("harness", "product", "isolated", "root-agent")
root = EverOSAdapter.memory_root_for_scope(Path(".memory") / "everos", scope)
os.environ["EVEROS_ROOT"] = str(root)
surface = load_vendored_everos_public_surface(memory_root=root)
adapter = EverOSAdapter(scope=scope, base_root=Path(".memory") / "everos", surface=surface)
```

An EverOS root is process-bound.  Once a public surface is loaded, do not
change or unset `EVEROS_ROOT`: payload, memorize, and search operations fail
closed if the current public `MemoryRoot` differs from the captured root, and a
second different root is rejected in the same process.  To use another root,
start a fresh Python process, configure that root before import, then load its
surface.  The dependency-light local suite honestly skips the real EverOS
integration when this optional installation is absent.

For a claimant-aware, source-owned EverOS ingestion, settle the effect and
ingestion through `MemoryStore.settle_external_experience_ingestion(operation_id,
ingestion_id, *, claim_id, claim_generation, mode, reason=None,
ingestion_uncertain=False, evidence=None, case_receipts=())`. The returned
`(operation, ingestion, disposition)` is the durable pair. `mode="uncertain"`
requires the issuing store handle and a reason; `ingestion_uncertain=True`
marks both rows uncertain, while the default leaves a pending ingestion for
readback. Its dispositions are `uncertain` or `already_uncertain`.
`mode="acknowledged"` accepts an exact active claim from a readback peer. Pass
operation-bound evidence with `adapter_proof` containing the original session,
scope, and complete sorted case IDs, plus all matching case receipts. It
confirms the effect, ingestion, receipts, and local bridge together, returning
`confirmed`. Exact confirmed replay, including a late uncertainty after peer
confirmation, returns `already_confirmed` without changing versions. A wrong
claim, incomplete proof, or conflicting receipt raises `OperationConflictError`
without a partial settlement. This API does not record STEP-11 usage receipts;
the caller records an authentic native usage receipt separately.
The retained payload may use either the exact reviewed scope labels or the
public EverOS adapter's matching `mh-app-`, `mh-project-`, and `mh-owner-`
transport IDs; all three fields must use the same form. The transport suffix
is the first 32 hex characters of `sha256_hex({"value": raw_scope_label})`.

Generated EverOS skills remain proposed historical candidates.  Approval is
deny-by-default: `ReviewedExperienceService` requires a configured
`TrustedApprovalVerifier` to authenticate the exact durable candidate, issuer,
scope, and requested recipient set and return `VerifiedApproval` evidence.
The durable approval retains that evidence and preserves the candidate's
`generated` origin; approval does not publish, designate, inject, or execute
the content.

## Optional Atlas trusted-procedure adapter

Install `memory-harness[atlas]` only in a ROOT-controlled environment that is
authorized to use Atlas.  `AtlasProcedureAdapter` uses the public
`MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch` surface solely to discover stable publication IDs;
it exact-reads complete records and lifecycle controls from the supplied
PyMongo collection before any delivery.  Private/local partitions are never
published remotely, and the adapter's configured Atlas metric must match each
published representation.
